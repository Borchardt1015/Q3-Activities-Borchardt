	<p class="Para1" style="color: darkred;">I used to be a renegade<br>
	I used to fool around<br>
	But I couldn't take the punishment<br>
	And had to settle down<br>
	Now I'm playing it real straight<br>
	And yes, I cut my hair<br>
	You might think I'm crazy<br>
	But I don't even care<br>
	'Cause I can tell what's going on<br>
	It's hip to be square<br>
	It's hip to be square<br>
	I like my bands in business suits<br>
	I watch them on TV<br>
	I'm working out most every day<br>
	And watchin' what I eat<br>
	They tell me that it's good for me<br>
	But I don't even care<br>
	I know that it's crazy<br>
	I know that it's nowhere<br>
	But there is no denying that<br>
	It's hip to be square<br>
	It's hip to be square<br>
	It's hip to be square<br>
	So hip to be square</p>

	<p class="Para2" style="color: darkred;">It's not too hard to figure out<br>
	You see it every day<br>
	And those that were the farthest out<br>
	Have gone the other way<br>
	You see them on the freeway<br>
	It don't look like a lot of fun<br>
	But don't you try to fight it<br>
	An idea whose time has come<br>
	Don't tell me that I'm crazy<br>
	Don't tell me I'm nowhere<br>
	Take it from me<br>
	It's hip to be square<br>
	It's hip to be square<br>
	It's hip to be square<br>
	So hip to be square<br>
	Tell 'em, boys<br>
	So hip to be square<br>
	(Hip, hip)</p>
